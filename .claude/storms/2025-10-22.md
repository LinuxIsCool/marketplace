# Claude-Crawl Plugin Architecture with Crawl4AI Integration

## User Input
OK let's brainstorm. What do we want to achieve with this marketplace repository? One of the main places to begin is the crawl plugin. I want the crawl plugin to know how to use crawl4ai. We will make a skill in the crawl plugin for using crawl4ai. We will also think about what commands / agents / hooks to create. We will have to define subagents so that we can crawl a website in parallel. We will also want to add hooks so that any time claude does a websearch or webfetch we scrape the data. We will probably want to make commands that map to crawl4ais capabilities / commands / parameters.

## Reflection

This is a comprehensive architectural planning session for the claude-crawl plugin. The vision is clear: integrate crawl4ai as a core capability within the Claude Code marketplace ecosystem. Here are the key insights and considerations:

### Core Architecture Components

1. **Skill-based Integration**: Creating a dedicated crawl4ai skill will encapsulate the library's functionality and make it reusable across commands and agents. This provides a clean separation of concerns and enables consistent crawl4ai usage patterns.

2. **Hook-driven Automation**: The proposal to hook into websearch/webfetch is particularly innovative - it creates a seamless augmentation layer where Claude automatically scrapes and enriches web data during normal operations. This transforms passive web fetching into active knowledge extraction.

3. **Parallel Crawling via Subagents**: Defining subagents for parallel crawling demonstrates scalability thinking from the start. This will be essential for crawling multiple pages or sites efficiently, enabling tasks like sitemap traversal or multi-domain research.

4. **Command Mapping Strategy**: Mapping crawl4ai's capabilities to commands will provide users with explicit control over crawling operations while maintaining access to the library's full feature set.

### Critical Architectural Decisions to Address

- **Integration Method**: How will the skill interface with crawl4ai? (Python subprocess, API wrapper, direct library import?)
- **Data Flow**: What data format will hooks use to pass scraped data back to the main context? JSON, markdown, or structured objects?
- **Coordination**: How will subagents coordinate and merge results from parallel crawls? Need a result aggregation strategy.
- **Abstraction Level**: Should commands be 1:1 with crawl4ai features or provide higher-level abstractions for common workflows?
- **Resource Management**: How to handle rate limiting, caching, and storage of crawled data? Consider disk space and performance.
- **Error Handling**: What happens when crawls fail? Retry logic, partial results, user notification?

### Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1: Foundation**
- Research crawl4ai capabilities and API surface
- Create basic skill structure with core crawl functionality
- Build simple command to test crawl4ai integration

**Phase 2: Hooks & Automation**
- Implement websearch/webfetch hooks
- Define hook data format and context passing
- Test automatic scraping augmentation

**Phase 3: Parallelization**
- Design subagent protocol for crawl tasks
- Implement parallel crawling with result merging
- Add queue management for crawl jobs

**Phase 4: Feature Completeness**
- Map all crawl4ai commands to plugin commands
- Add configuration options and user preferences
- Implement caching and storage layer
- Documentation and examples

This brainstorm establishes a solid foundation for building a production-ready web crawling plugin that deeply integrates with Claude Code's workflow.

## User Input
The storm plugin should have a way of monitoring tasks, perhaps using hooks. Completed tasks should be associated with a git commit. There should be a way to list all tasks or all open tasks or all open tasks, I guess using a command with an argument. There should be a way to render the network of storms and tags and tasks. There should be a way of reviewing or working on storms in parallel using subagents.

## Reflection
This brainstorm introduces sophisticated meta-tooling for the storm plugin itself, transforming it from a simple note-taking system into a comprehensive project management and knowledge graph platform. The ideas here demonstrate deep systems thinking about how brainstorming connects to actual implementation work.

### Key Architectural Innovations

1. **Task Monitoring via Hooks**: Integrating with Claude Code's hook system would allow the storm plugin to automatically track task progress in real-time. When a task is marked as complete in a storm file, a hook could trigger to:
   - Update task status across all storms
   - Create cross-references between related tasks
   - Generate progress reports
   - Trigger the git commit association flow

2. **Git Commit Association**: This is brilliant! Linking completed tasks to git commits creates a bidirectional traceability system:
   - From task → See what code changes fulfilled it
   - From commit → See what higher-level goal it served
   - Enables powerful analytics: velocity, cycle time, completion rates
   - Creates an audit trail of "why" for every change

   Implementation considerations:
   - Store commit SHA in task metadata when marked complete
   - Parse commit messages for task references (e.g., "Closes storm-002-task-3")
   - Pre-commit hook to check for associated tasks
   - Post-commit hook to auto-update storm files

3. **Task Listing Commands**: The command should support rich filtering:
   ```
   /storm:tasks --status=open
   /storm:tasks --status=closed --since=2025-10-01
   /storm:tasks --tag=crawl4ai
   /storm:tasks --storm=002
   /storm:tasks --all
   ```
   This provides multiple views into the task ecosystem.

4. **Network Visualization**: This is the most ambitious feature - rendering the knowledge graph of:
   - Storms (nodes) connected by related_storms (edges)
   - Tags creating thematic clusters
   - Tasks as child nodes of storms
   - Git commits as leaf nodes connected to tasks

   Visualization options:
   - **Static SVG/PNG**: Generate with GraphViz (dot format)
   - **Interactive HTML**: Use D3.js force-directed graph
   - **Terminal UI**: ASCII art graph using blessed or similar
   - **Mermaid diagrams**: Markdown-native visualization

   The graph could reveal:
   - Orphaned storms (no connections)
   - Central/hub storms (many connections)
   - Task completion bottlenecks
   - Tag-based thematic patterns

5. **Parallel Storm Processing with Subagents**: This opens fascinating possibilities:
   - Assign different storms to different subagents
   - Work on multiple related features simultaneously
   - Each subagent reports back with progress updates
   - Main agent aggregates and coordinates work

   Use cases:
   - Multi-stream development (frontend + backend + docs)
   - Research parallelization (each subagent explores different approaches)
   - Code review across multiple storms/PRs
   - Dependency resolution (one subagent per dependency)

### Implementation Architecture

**Phase 1: Task Tracking Foundation**
- Parse storm files to extract all tasks
- Create task index with status tracking
- Implement basic listing commands
- Build task update mechanisms

**Phase 2: Git Integration**
- Design commit association schema
- Implement pre/post-commit hooks
- Add commit SHA to task metadata
- Create bidirectional lookup (task↔commit)

**Phase 3: Visualization Layer**
- Extract network data from storms
- Implement GraphViz generator
- Create interactive HTML variant
- Add filtering and focus capabilities

**Phase 4: Parallel Processing**
- Define subagent protocol for storm work
- Implement task assignment algorithm
- Build progress aggregation system
- Create coordination and conflict resolution

### Cross-Storm Synergies

This storm (002) actually complements storm 001 beautifully:
- Both use hooks extensively
- Both leverage subagents for parallelization
- Task tracking could monitor crawl plugin development
- Network visualization could show crawl plugin architecture

The storm plugin is becoming a meta-tool that orchestrates and visualizes the entire marketplace development process!
