# Claude-Crawl Plugin Architecture with Crawl4AI Integration

## User Input
OK let's brainstorm. What do we want to achieve with this marketplace repository? One of the main places to begin is the crawl plugin. I want the crawl plugin to know how to use crawl4ai. We will make a skill in the crawl plugin for using crawl4ai. We will also think about what commands / agents / hooks to create. We will have to define subagents so that we can crawl a website in parallel. We will also want to add hooks so that any time claude does a websearch or webfetch we scrape the data. We will probably want to make commands that map to crawl4ais capabilities / commands / parameters.

## Reflection

This is a comprehensive architectural planning session for the claude-crawl plugin. The vision is clear: integrate crawl4ai as a core capability within the Claude Code marketplace ecosystem. Here are the key insights and considerations:

### Core Architecture Components

1. **Skill-based Integration**: Creating a dedicated crawl4ai skill will encapsulate the library's functionality and make it reusable across commands and agents. This provides a clean separation of concerns and enables consistent crawl4ai usage patterns.

2. **Hook-driven Automation**: The proposal to hook into websearch/webfetch is particularly innovative - it creates a seamless augmentation layer where Claude automatically scrapes and enriches web data during normal operations. This transforms passive web fetching into active knowledge extraction.

3. **Parallel Crawling via Subagents**: Defining subagents for parallel crawling demonstrates scalability thinking from the start. This will be essential for crawling multiple pages or sites efficiently, enabling tasks like sitemap traversal or multi-domain research.

4. **Command Mapping Strategy**: Mapping crawl4ai's capabilities to commands will provide users with explicit control over crawling operations while maintaining access to the library's full feature set.

### Critical Architectural Decisions to Address

- **Integration Method**: How will the skill interface with crawl4ai? (Python subprocess, API wrapper, direct library import?)
- **Data Flow**: What data format will hooks use to pass scraped data back to the main context? JSON, markdown, or structured objects?
- **Coordination**: How will subagents coordinate and merge results from parallel crawls? Need a result aggregation strategy.
- **Abstraction Level**: Should commands be 1:1 with crawl4ai features or provide higher-level abstractions for common workflows?
- **Resource Management**: How to handle rate limiting, caching, and storage of crawled data? Consider disk space and performance.
- **Error Handling**: What happens when crawls fail? Retry logic, partial results, user notification?

### Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1: Foundation**
- Research crawl4ai capabilities and API surface
- Create basic skill structure with core crawl functionality
- Build simple command to test crawl4ai integration

**Phase 2: Hooks & Automation**
- Implement websearch/webfetch hooks
- Define hook data format and context passing
- Test automatic scraping augmentation

**Phase 3: Parallelization**
- Design subagent protocol for crawl tasks
- Implement parallel crawling with result merging
- Add queue management for crawl jobs

**Phase 4: Feature Completeness**
- Map all crawl4ai commands to plugin commands
- Add configuration options and user preferences
- Implement caching and storage layer
- Documentation and examples

This brainstorm establishes a solid foundation for building a production-ready web crawling plugin that deeply integrates with Claude Code's workflow.
